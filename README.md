Git mirror of the ElectricSleep project to monitor movements during sleep and smart alarm.

ElectricSleep (a la Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) is an Android application designed to monitor movements during sleep. The movements it registers can signify sleep stages. Aside from providing analysis and insight into the users' sleep patterns, the user can set an alarm to wake them at the best possible moment, so as to feel refreshed and more awake than with a traditional alarm.
