# Introduction #

ElectricSleep is reliant on several other open-source projects and snippets of code. This wiki page will be used to help document these depencies and give credit where credit is due.


# Libraries #

**AChartEngine** http://www.achartengine.org/ 0.5.0
> Efficient and open-source charting library used for logging and displaying sleep movement data.

# Borrowed Code or Concepts #

**Smart Alarm Clock**  http://www.smart-alarm-clock.com/
> Inspirational Android App for project, which seems to be defunct, and doesn't work reliably on latest versions of Android.

**David Webb** http://thebigbyte.blogspot.com/2010/06/android-using-accelerometer-to.html
> Borrowed code snippet for calculating force; helped clarify how built-in accelerometers output data.

**Google IOSched App** http://code.google.com/p/iosched/
> Borrowed a lot of UI code and concepts

**Accelerometer Service snippet** http://stackoverflow.com/revisions/77de9d5a-a9dd-488a-8e30-8f0041939bfd/view-source
> Borrowed some structure for my accelerometer sensor service from i4ndroid's post
