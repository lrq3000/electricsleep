# Dependencies notes

## Introduction
ElectricSleep is reliant on several other open-source projects and snippets of code. This wiki page will be used to help document these depencies and give credit where credit is due.

## Libraries

- AChartEngine http://www.achartengine.org/ 0.5.0

Efficient and open-source charting library used for logging and displaying sleep movement data.
Borrowed Code or Concepts

- Smart Alarm Clock http://www.smart-alarm-clock.com/

Inspirational Android App for project, which seems to be defunct, and doesn't work reliably on latest versions of Android.

- David Webb http://thebigbyte.blogspot.com/2010/06/android-using-accelerometer-to.html

Borrowed code snippet for calculating force; helped clarify how built-in accelerometers output data.

- Google IOSched App http://code.google.com/p/iosched/

Borrowed a lot of UI code and concepts

- Accelerometer Service snippet http://stackoverflow.com/revisions/77de9d5a-a9dd-488a-8e30-8f0041939bfd/view-source

Borrowed some structure for my accelerometer sensor service from i4ndroid's post
